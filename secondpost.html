                        <p>The world of Aviation is one of the most male dominated occupations there is with well over hundreds of thousands of male pilots, whether that be commercial, private, military, or transport there never seems to be a shortage.</>
                        <p>Within the world of aviation female pilots make up roughly 8.2% of all commercial pilots as of 2022. Due to the stereotpyes that fuel society women are looked down upon and are seen as unprepared for such sutaitions and tasks. Women are often times descriminated against as most women feel they would run the risk of being sexually harrased in the work place.</p>
                        <p>Most women who work in the aviation world work as flight attendents which is also looked down upon and demoralizing as they're job is viewed as easy and takes no training. In 2022 it was reported that around 72,428 women held the position and title of a pilot or worked in some form close to the pilot. Many of these women were either students or flew for other reasons besides commercial or private.</p>
                        <p>Men have dominated the aviation world since flight was possible, In world war 2 women were forced to work in hospitals and were unable to fly or work on planes during the time. In todays society women have been making strides within the U.S. military and airforce, roughly 7.7% of all U.S. military pilots are female and are increasing ever so slightly. Women have begun to take the aviation world by storm as more and more women continue to push the agenda and break the social barrier forcing the world to stare in amazement. Though the population of female pilots may be increasing we could still do more to make our society a more inclusive place.</p>
